I remember @Hackerfrogs said one time on his live stream , that if u havent document it - it never happened !

so as time goes by and i am learning something new or doing something new will create a file for that ~ reference u can see and learn

I tend to forget things fast and so i can also go back in past and see what i did ... its helpful u should try documenting too!
