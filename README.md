I recall @Hackerfrogs stating during a live stream that if something isn't documented, it's as if it never occurred.

Therefore, as I learn or do new things, I will create a file for reference, enabling review and learning.

I tend to forget things quickly, so this allows me to revisit past actions. It's beneficial, and I recommend documenting your work as well.
